Executive Summary: A Unified Validation ArchitectureThis document presents the definitive architectural plan for integrating payload validation into the flatstream-rs library. The analysis synthesizes three evolutionary design documents (V2_X_VALIDATION_V1.md, V2_X_VALIDATION_V2.md, V2_X_VALIDATION_V3.md) with the library's existing source code to resolve all design ambiguities and establish a single, authoritative implementation path.1The Problem: A Critical Production-Readiness GapThe current flatstream-rs implementation provides robust payload integrity guarantees through its composable Checksum trait.1 However, it lacks any mechanism for payload safety validation within the core streaming pipeline. The StreamDeserialize trait can perform flatbuffers verification, but this occurs after the payload has been deframed and passed to application-level logic.1This design exposes a critical gap: malformed, invalid, or malicious FlatBuffer payloads are delivered directly to the application, which can lead to panics, corrupted state, or undefined behavior at the point of deserialization.1 This is an unacceptable risk for any robust, production-ready system. The provided design documents address the need to add a validation layer within the framing/deframing pipeline to reject these malformed payloads early.1The Architectural Choice: Strategy-Coupled DesignThe three provided design documents represent the evolution of a single idea, not a set of competing options.1V2_X_VALIDATION_V1.md (Obsolete): This initial draft proposed a type-coupled anti-pattern.1 By tying validation to the specific FlatBuffer data type (e.g., ValidatingFramer<F, TelemetryEvent>), it fundamentally breaks the library's core philosophy of composable, type-agnostic behavioral traits.1 This design is inflexible, non-composable, and architecturally misaligned.V2_X_VALIDATION_V2.md (The Blueprint): This document presents the correct, strategy-coupled design.1 It introduces a Validator trait that perfectly parallels the existing and proven Checksum trait.1 This design correctly identifies validation as a pluggable, orthogonal behavior, complete with a NoValidator for zero-cost abstraction, a StructuralValidator for base safety, and a CompositeValidator for extensibility.1V2_X_VALIDATION_V3.md (The Philosophy): This summary provides the core philosophical justification for the V2 design.1 It correctly aligns the feature with the safety-first principles of modern zero-copy serialization frameworks like rkyv, which mandate upfront validation before data access.1The Recommendation: A Unified Implementation PlanThis report formally adopts the design from V2_X_VALIDATION_V2.md as the architectural blueprint for the validation feature.1 The implementation will proceed by integrating this new capability as a composable, non-breaking adapter pattern, a synthesis of the V2 trait and the adapter pattern already present in the src/framing.rs module (e.g., BoundedDeframer).1The implementation will consist of:Creating a new src/validation.rs module to house the Validator trait and its implementations as defined in V2.1Creating ValidatingFramer and ValidatingDeframer adapters that wrap existing Framer and Deframer implementations to inject validation logic.Updating the FramerExt and DeframerExt traits to provide a fluent API for adding the validation layer.This approach maintains 100% backward compatibility, provides a true zero-cost abstraction via NoValidator 1, and establishes a powerful new vector of extensibility for the library. The V2_X_VALIDATION_V1.md document will be formally archived to prevent future architectural confusion.1Analysis of the flatstream-rs Core Architecture (The Ground Truth)Before introducing a new feature, it is imperative to analyze the existing "ground truth" of the library's architecture, as defined by the src/ source code.1 Any new feature must adhere to and strengthen these established principles. The flatstream-rs architecture is governed by three primary rules.Core Principle 1: Orthogonal, Composable TraitsThe library's design is built on an elegant separation of concerns, managed by distinct, orthogonal traits.Framing (Framer/Deframer): These traits, defined in src/framing.rs, are responsible for the wire format.1 Their sole concern is how a payload &[u8] is prepended with its 4-byte length and (optionally) a checksum, and how the corresponding std::io read/write operations are performed. They are the "transport" layer of the library.Integrity (Checksum): This trait, defined in src/checksum.rs, is responsible for data integrity.1 It is a pluggable strategy for calculating and verifying a checksum over a &[u8] payload. Implementations like XxHash64, Crc32, and Crc16 provide different algorithms, but the interface is standardized.1This separation is the library's greatest strength. The Framer does not need to know how a checksum is calculated, only that a Checksum implementation can provide one. This orthogonality is the foundation of composability and must be preserved.Core Principle 2: The Zero-Cost Abstraction PrecedentThe single most important implementation in the entire library, from an architectural perspective, is NoChecksum.1Definition: NoChecksum is a struct that implements the Checksum trait with no-op methods. Its size() method returns 0, calculate() returns 0, and verify() unconditionally returns Ok(()).1First-Order Effect: This allows users to opt-out of checksumming, for example, by using the DefaultFramer, which is hard-coded to a 0-byte checksum size.1Second-Order Effect (The Architectural Guarantee): NoChecksum is not merely an option; it is the library's philosophical guarantee of zero-cost abstraction. It establishes a critical, non-negotiable precedent: any new, optional, cross-cutting concern (such as validation) must provide an equivalent No... struct. This struct's methods must be no-ops, marked #[inline(always)] where appropriate, ensuring that when a user does not need the feature, it is fully optimized away by the compiler and has zero runtime performance cost.The V2_X_VALIDATION_V2.md document explicitly provides a NoValidator implementation that perfectly mirrors NoChecksum.1 This demonstrates a deep and correct understanding of this core architectural principle. The V1 document, in contrast, lacks this concept entirely, revealing its architectural misalignment.1Core Principle 3: The Composition PatternsThe src/ code 1 demonstrates two distinct patterns for composing these orthogonal behaviors.The Replacement Pattern: This is seen in ChecksumFramer<C: Checksum>.1 This struct is not an adapter; it is a complete replacement for DefaultFramer. It re-implements the entire frame_and_write logic, manually composing the length-prefixing logic with calls to its generic C: Checksum member.The Adapter Pattern: This is seen in BoundedDeframer<D: Deframer> and the other adapters in src/framing.rs.1 This struct wraps an inner deframer (inner: D). Its read_and_deframe method adds new behavior (checking the payload_len against self.max) and then delegates the rest of the work to self.inner.read_after_length(...).1Of these two, the Adapter Pattern is architecturally superior. It is more flexible, adheres to the single-responsibility principle, and is far more composable. For example, a BoundedDeframer can wrap a DefaultDeframer or a ChecksumDeframer with equal ease.The V2 document proposes a replacement pattern: ValidatingChecksumFramer<C, V>.1 While functional, this is a suboptimal integration strategy. It unnecessarily couples validation and checksumming into a single struct.The architecturally correct path is to follow the BoundedDeframer precedent. This report will therefore recommend the implementation of a ValidatingDeframer<D: Deframer, V: Validator> adapter. This adapter will be able to wrap any other Deframer (e.g., DefaultDeframer, ChecksumDeframer<Crc32>, or even UnsafeDeframer), allowing validation to be stacked orthogonally with any other existing or future behavior. This synthesizes the V2 trait with the library's best-in-class composition pattern.The Architectural Imperative: Payload Validation as a First-Class ConcernThe implementation of this feature is not optional; it is a mandatory step in evolving flatstream-rs from a high-performance tool into a robust, production-grade library. The core issue is the violation of trust boundaries.The Trust Boundary Violation in the Current APIA review of the existing StreamReader API in src/reader.rs 1 reveals the flaw.The StreamReader::process_all method, the primary high-performance API, yields a raw &[u8] payload to an application-provided closure.1The StreamReader::process_typed method is a convenience wrapper around process_all that invokes the StreamDeserialize trait on this raw payload.1The StreamDeserialize trait's from_payload method is where flatbuffers::get_root or flatbuffers::root_with_opts is finally called.1This is a fundamental violation of trust boundaries. The StreamReader is effectively handing a "live grenade"—a potentially malicious or malformed byte slice—directly to the application, trusting it to handle the payload safely.1 A crash inside the process_all closure (due to a panic in flatbuffers::get_root) will bring down the entire stream-processing task.A robust library must guarantee that any data it yields to application code has passed a minimum safety bar. The existing ChecksumDeframer 1 is insufficient. It only guarantees that the bytes received are the same bytes that were sent (i.e., they weren't flipped by bitrot or network corruption). It makes no guarantee that those bytes describe a valid, safe-to-access data structure.Therefore, validation must be moved from the application layer (i.e., inside the StreamDeserialize implementation) to the library's pipeline (i.e., inside the Deframer).The rkyv Precedent for Upfront ValidationThe V2_X_VALIDATION_V3.md document correctly identifies the safety philosophy of the rkyv project as the ideal model for flatstream-rs.1rkyv is a zero-copy deserialization framework that, like FlatBuffers, allows for "deserialization" by-casting, which is an unsafe operation that reinterprets a byte buffer as a complex struct.1 To make this safe, rkyv provides an optional validation system called bytecheck.2The rkyv bytecheck philosophy is one of upfront validation.7 It is a trait-based system that allows a user to perform a single, fast, upfront check on an entire buffer.8 This check recursively verifies:Structural integrityCorrect memory alignment of all fieldsValidity of all pointers (e.g., ensuring they point within the buffer boundaries)Absence of invalid or overlapping data 6Only after this bytecheck pass succeeds is the application permitted to perform the unsafe cast to access the data.6This is exactly the model flatstream-rs must adopt. The flatbuffers crate has this capability (flatbuffers::verify_...), but flatstream-rs currently invokes it too late. The V2/V3 proposal is to move this check inside the Deframer pipeline.By making this change, flatstream-rs transforms from a simple streaming tool into a safe streaming tool. It provides the same class of memory safety guarantees that rkyv does, preventing an entire class of panics, vulnerabilities, and data-corruption exploits stemming from malformed data.9 The StructuralValidator proposed in V2, with its use of the type-agnostic flatbuffers::verify_size_prefixed_root::<flatbuffers::Table>, is the correct, general-purpose verifier to implement this philosophy, perfectly mirroring rkyv's bytecheck.1Comparative Architectural Analysis of Proposed Validation StrategiesThe V1 and V2 documents 1 present a fundamental dichotomy in design: coupling validation to data (V1) versus coupling it to behavior (V2). An analysis of these two strategies against the architectural principles established in Section 2 reveals that V2 is the only viable path forward. The V1 design is fatally flawed.The following table provides a stark, side-by-side comparison of the two proposed architectures.FeatureV1: Type-Coupled Design (Obsolete) V2: Strategy-Coupled Design (Correct) Architectural VerdictCore Traitpub trait StructuralValidationpub trait Validator: Send + SyncV2 Wins. V2's trait is a behavioral strategy (like Checksum), defining an action to be taken. V1's trait is a marker on a data type, conflating data with behavior.Implementationimpl<T> StructuralValidation for T (Implemented by the data struct itself, e.g., TelemetryEvent).struct StructuralValidator; (Implemented by a separate strategy struct).V2 Wins. V2 correctly separates the validation logic from the data it validates, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.IntegrationValidatingFramer<F, V: StructuralValidation> (where V is the data type, e.g., TelemetryEvent).1ValidatingChecksumFramer<C, V: Validator> (where V is the strategy, e.g., StructuralValidator).V2 Wins. V2's integration is type-agnostic. The framer does not know or care about TelemetryEvent. V1's is type-specific, breaking its utility for streams with mixed message types.ComposabilityNone. Cannot stack validators. The V generic parameter is a single data type. A user cannot validate Size and Structure.Excellent. CompositeValidator explicitly allows for stacking multiple validation strategies (e.g., SizeValidator + StructuralValidator).V2 Wins. V2 is designed for extensibility by default; V1 is a fixed-function, architectural dead end.Zero-Cost PathNone. The design has no NoValidator equivalent. Opting-out means using a completely different framer struct.Perfect. NoValidator provides a no-op implementation with #[inline(always)], exactly mirroring the NoChecksum precedent.1V2 Wins. V2 respects the most critical performance principle of the library. It makes validation an option that costs nothing when disabled.AlignmentPoor. Does not align with the Checksum pattern. It introduces a new, conflicting, and inferior pattern based on data-type generics.Perfect. A direct parallel to the Checksum trait, proving the designer understood the core architecture and intended to strengthen it.V2 Wins. V2 strengthens the library's core philosophy; V1 fragments it.This analysis is conclusive. The V1 design fails every single test of architectural soundness, while the V2 design passes perfectly.Design Defect: The Architectural Flaws of the V1 (Type-Coupled) ProposalThe V2_X_VALIDATION_V1.md document 1 must be formally rejected and archived. Its design is not merely different; it is fundamentally flawed and would inflict long-term damage on the library's architecture and API ergonomics.Fundamental Flaw: Confusion of Data and BehaviorThe V1 design is built on a basic confusion between data and behavior. It proposes a StructuralValidation trait that is implemented by the data schema itself: impl<T> StructuralValidation for T where T: flatbuffers::Follow<'a> +....1The validation logic is then coupled to this data type in the framer: pub struct ValidatingFramer<F: Framer, V: StructuralValidation>.1 The usage example provided in the V1 document's migration path reveals the flaw:let validating_framer = ValidatingFramer::<DefaultFramer, TelemetryEvent>::new(); 1In this single line, the framer—a component of the I/O transport layer—is now permanently hard-coded to the application-layer data schema TelemetryEvent. This is a catastrophic violation of separation of concerns.Failure Mode 1: The "Mixed-Message Stream" ProblemThis type-coupling renders the V1 design useless for its primary use case. A high-performance telemetry or event stream will almost never contain only one message type. A real-world stream will contain a mix of TelemetryEvent, SystemLog, Heartbeat, ErrorPacket, and ConfigUpdate messages.With the V1 design, the StreamWriter would be locked into a ValidatingFramer<..., TelemetryEvent>. When it tried to write a SystemLog message, it would fail, as the framer is incapable of validating it. This would require the application to create, manage, and multiplex multiple StreamWriter instances, one for each message type, or to abandon validation entirely.This is a complete failure of API design. In contrast, the V2 StructuralValidator is type-agnostic. Its validate method uses flatbuffers::verify_size_prefixed_root::<flatbuffers::Table>.1 This is the correct approach. The framing layer should not know or care about application-level schemas; it should only validate that the payload is a structurally valid FlatBuffer table, regardless of its specific type.Failure Mode 2: The "Stacked Validation" ProblemThe V1 design provides no mechanism for composing validation rules. Because the V generic is a single data type, a user cannot, for example, run a fast SizeValidator and then run a more expensive StructuralValidator. They are locked into the single, monolithic implementation provided by impl StructuralValidation for TelemetryEvent.The V2 design, with its CompositeValidator, explicitly solves this problem from day one.1 It proves that the "strategy" approach is inherently extensible, turning "validation" from a single boolean check into a rich, programmable pipeline.Failure Mode 3: The "Zero-Cost Abstraction" ProblemThe V1 design provides no NoValidator equivalent. To opt-out of validation, a user must abandon ValidatingFramer entirely and use a different framer type, such as DefaultFramer or ChecksumFramer.1This creates a disjointed and "gappy" API. It prevents a user from using a single, unified pipeline that can be configured for different environments (e.g., validation on in production, off in benchmarks). The V2 NoValidator 1 solves this perfectly. It allows a user to configure a validating pipeline that, at compile time, is optimized to do no validation, thus respecting the library's core zero-cost abstraction principle.Conclusion of V1 AnalysisThe V1 design 1 is a "dead-end" architecture. It is inflexible, non-composable, non-performant (by lacking a zero-cost path), and fundamentally misaligned with the library's core principles. It is formally rejected, as recommended by the "Summary / Task Notes".1The Recommended Architecture: The V2 (Strategy-Coupled) FrameworkThe V2_X_VALIDATION_V2.md document 1 presents an architecture that is not only "good," but perfectly aligned with the existing library. It is the correct and only path forward.Perfect Architectural AlignmentThe V2 design is built on a Validator trait 1, a behavioral strategy trait that is a perfect parallel to the Checksum trait.1Checksum defines an integrity strategy.Validator defines a safety strategy.This design is a testament to understanding the existing architecture. It introduces a new, orthogonal axis of composition. A user can now select a framing strategy, an integrity strategy, and a safety strategy independently, and the library will compose them.The Power of NoValidator: A Unifying RefactorAs established in Section 2, NoValidator 1 is the most critical component for a composable library, as it guarantees zero performance penalty for users who do not opt-in.The implications of this are deeper than just performance; NoValidator enables a unifying refactor of the library's core types. Instead of having a fragmented set of types (DefaultDeframer, ChecksumDeframer, and a new ValidatingDeframer), we can unify them.The ValidatingDeframer<D, V> adapter (proposed in Section 7) becomes the new "base" primitive. The old types can then become simple, backward-compatible type aliases:pub type BaseDeframer =...; // The new inner-most deframerpub type DefaultDeframer = ValidatingDeframer<BaseDeframer, NoValidator>;pub type ChecksumDeframer<C> = ValidatingDeframer<BaseChecksumDeframer<C>, NoValidator>;This makes the V2 proposal not just an addition, but a simplification of the library's conceptual model. All deframers become validating deframers; most simply use NoValidator by default.Unbounded Extensibility: The Validation-as-a-PlatformThe V2 design future-proofs the library. The CompositeValidator 1 is the key, allowing users to create powerful, stacked validation pipelines:let pipeline = CompositeValidator::new().add(SizeValidator::new(64, 1024)).add(StructuralValidator::new());This proves the "strategy" approach is correct. It turns "validation" from a single check into a programmable pipeline. The future extensibility proposals in V2—such as InstrumentedValidator for metrics, ABTestValidator for production comparisons, and CriticalFieldValidator for domain-specific logic 1—are all made possible only because the base design is a flexible, composable trait.Definitive Implementation Plan and API DesignThis section provides the concrete, code-first blueprint for implementation. It synthesizes the V2 Validator trait 1 with the superior adapter pattern from the src/ code.1Step 1: Create src/validation.rsThis new module will be created to house the Validator trait and its core implementations, as detailed in V2_X_VALIDATION_V2.md.1Trait Definition:Rustuse crate::error::{Error, Result};

    }
}
Step 4: Update src/framing.rs Extension TraitsTo provide a fluent API and make these adapters discoverable, the FramerExt and DeframerExt traits 1 must be updated.Rust// In src/framing.rs

        ValidatingFramer::new(self, validator)
    }
}

/// Extension methods for deframers to enable fluent composition.
pub trait DeframerExt: Deframer + Sized {
    /// Enforce a maximum payload length.
    fn bounded(self, max: usize) -> BoundedDeframer<Self> {
        BoundedDeframer::new(self, max)
    }

    //... existing.observed()...

    /// Adds a validation layer to this deframer.
    fn with_validator<V: Validator>(self, validator: V) -> ValidatingDeframer<Self, V> {
        ValidatingDeframer::new(self, validator)
    }
}
Step 5: Final API Usage (The Payoff)This implementation plan results in a beautiful, composable, and 100% backward-compatible API.Before (Current API from src/ 1):Rust// In application code:
let deframer = BoundedDeframer::new(
    ChecksumDeframer::new(Crc32::new()),
    1024 * 1024 // 1MB limit
);
let mut reader = StreamReader::new(file, deframer);
After (New Fluent, Composable API):Rust// In application code:
// (Assuming `ChecksumDeframer` is also refactored to an adapter
// or `DefaultDeframer` is aliased, following the pattern)

// Start with a base deframer and fluently add capabilities
let deframer = DefaultDeframer::default()
  .bounded(1024 * 1024) // Add size limit
  .with_validator(TableRootValidator::new()); // Add safety

// Or, a fully-featured pipeline:
let deframer = DefaultDeframer::default()
  .with_checksum(Crc32::new()) // (Hypothetical fluent checksum)
  .bounded(1024 * 1024)
  .with_validator(
        CompositeValidator::new()
          .add(SizeValidator::new(64, 1024 * 1024))
          .add(TableRootValidator::new())
    );

let mut reader = StreamReader::new(file, deframer);

// The application can now call `reader.process_all` with a
// strong guarantee that the payload is not malformed.
Future Architectural Extensibility (The V2 Platform)This implementation plan, based on the V2 design 1, accomplishes more than just adding a single feature. It establishes validation-as-a-platform, opening a new, stable axis of customization for the library. By defining a simple, stable Validator trait, we have enabled a rich ecosystem of future extensions, both for the core team and for end-users.Production-Grade HooksThe V2 proposals for InstrumentedValidator and DebugValidator 1 are key examples of this new platform's power.Metrics: An InstrumentedValidator can be implemented to wrap any other validator. It would execute the inner validate() call, but wrap it in a std::time::Instant block. It could then emit metrics (e.g., via Prometheus, or log::) on validation duration, payload sizes, and failure rates (by inspecting the Result). This provides critical, real-time operational insight into stream health with zero changes to application logic.Debugging: A DebugValidator 1 could be used to conditionally sample and log payloads that fail validation, or even a random 1% of payloads that pass, enabling production-environment debugging without performance impact.Domain-Specific Logic at the Stream BoundaryThe most profound long-term implication is the one surfaced by the CriticalFieldValidator proposal.1 This represents a fundamental shift in the library's capability.Because the Validator trait operates on the raw &[u8] payload before it is passed to StreamDeserialize, it allows an application to inject domain-specific business logic at the I/O boundary.Consider a high-throughput telemetry system. A CriticalFieldValidator could be written to:Read a device_id (u64) from a known, fixed offset in the FlatBuffer (a fast, unsafe read).Check this device_id against a HashSet or BloomFilter of whitelisted, active devices.If the ID is not in the set, return Err(Error::ValidationFailed) with reason "unknown device_id".The message is rejected before it is ever deserialized, before it is passed to the application's main logic, and before it can consume further processing resources. This moves application-aware filtering from the "slow path" (after full deserialization) to the "fast path" (inside the I/O pipeline). This powerful pattern for building high-performance, resource-efficient systems is made possible only because the V2 Validator trait is a flexible, composable, strategy-based design.
New Extensibility: TypedValidator for Schema-Aware Validation
The final implementation of `TypedValidator` improved on the initial design sketch by using a concrete struct that holds a function pointer. This avoids code bloat from generics and provides a more flexible API.

The `TypedValidator` provides a much stricter guarantee than the `TableRootValidator`:

*   **`TableRootValidator`**: Guarantees the payload is a structurally valid FlatBuffer table, without knowing its specific type.
*   **`TypedValidator`**: Guarantees the payload is a valid FlatBuffer for a *specific* root type `T` (e.g., `TelemetryEvent`).

Final Implementation:
```rust
/// A type-specific validator created for a concrete FlatBuffer root type.
pub struct TypedValidator {
    opts: flatbuffers::VerifierOptions,
    verify: fn(
        &flatbuffers::VerifierOptions,
        &[u8],
    ) -> core::result::Result<(), flatbuffers::InvalidFlatbuffer>,
    name_static: &'static str,
}

impl TypedValidator {
    /// Creates a typed validator for a root type `T` with default limits.
    pub fn for_type<T>() -> Self
    where
        for<'a> T: flatbuffers::Follow<'a> + flatbuffers::Verifiable,
    {
        Self {
            opts: flatbuffers::VerifierOptions::default(),
            verify: |opts, payload| flatbuffers::root_with_opts::<T>(opts, payload).map(|_| ()),
            name_static: std::any::type_name::<T>(),
        }
    }

    /// Creates a typed validator with custom limits for root type `T`.
    pub fn with_limits_for_type<T>(max_depth: usize, max_tables: usize) -> Self
    where
        for<'a> T: flatbuffers::Follow<'a> + flatbuffers::Verifiable,
    {
        let opts = flatbuffers::VerifierOptions {
            max_depth,
            max_tables,
            ..Default::default()
        };
        Self {
            opts,
            verify: |opts, payload| flatbuffers::root_with_opts::<T>(opts, payload).map(|_| ()),
            name_static: std::any::type_name::<T>(),
        }
    }

    /// Creates a typed validator from a schema-specific verification function
    /// and a static name for diagnostics.
    pub fn from_verify_named(
        name: &'static str,
        verify: fn(
            &flatbuffers::VerifierOptions,
            &[u8],
        ) -> core::result::Result<(), flatbuffers::InvalidFlatbuffer>,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            opts: flatbuffers::VerifierOptions::default(),
            verify,
            name_static: name,
        }
    }
}

impl Validator for TypedValidator {
    #[inline]
    fn validate(&self, payload: &[u8]) -> Result<()> {
        (self.verify)(&self.opts, payload).map_err(|e| Error::ValidationFailed {
            validator: self.name(),
            reason: e.to_string(),
        })
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
        self.name_static
    }
}
```

Composition Example:
This validator plugs directly into the `CompositeValidator`, allowing for powerful, layered validation pipelines.
```rust
// (Assuming `MyEventType` is a generated FlatBuffer struct)
let typed_validator = TypedValidator::for_type::<MyEventType>();

let pipeline = CompositeValidator::new()
  .add(SizeValidator::new(128, 4096))
  .add(TableRootValidator::new())
  .add(typed_validator);

let deframer = DefaultDeframer::default()
   .bounded(4096)
   .with_validator(pipeline);
```
This extension demonstrates the power of the V2 (Strategy-Coupled) design. By establishing a simple trait, we have created a stable platform for adding new, powerful, and domain-specific capabilities without altering the library's core.
ConclusionThe analysis of the evolutionary design documents and the existing source code is unambiguous.The V1 design 1 is architecturally unsound, non-composable, and misaligned with the library's core principles. It is formally rejected.The V2 design 1 is the correct architecture. Its Validator trait perfectly parallels the Checksum trait, respects the zero-cost abstraction principle, and provides a powerful platform for extensibility.The V3 document 1 provides the correct philosophical justification, aligning the V2 design with industry-best-practices for safety as seen in frameworks like rkyv.7The implementation shall proceed as detailed in Section 7 of this report. This involves creating the src/validation.rs module based on the V2 Validator trait and integrating it into the library using the superior ValidatingFramer/ValidatingDeframer adapter pattern, which is synthesized from the best parts of the V2 document and the existing src/framing.rs adapter design.1This implementation will close a critical production-readiness gap, transform flatstream-rs into a demonstrably safe streaming library, and provide a new, stable platform for future feature development.

Implementation Note: TableRootValidator verification strategy

One suggestion during review was to replace the explicit root-offset + `Verifier::visit_table(..)` approach with a single call to `flatbuffers::root_with_opts::<flatbuffers::Table>(..)`. We investigated this and kept the explicit verifier path for the following reasons:

1) `Table` is not `Verifiable` in the current Rust flatbuffers API
- The signature of `root_with_opts` requires `T: Follow<'a> + Verifiable`. `flatbuffers::Table<'_>` does not implement `Verifiable`, which leads to a compile-time error.
- As a result, `root_with_opts::<Table>` is not available for a type-agnostic validator.

2) Explicit `Verifier::visit_table(..)` is portable and type-agnostic
- We read the root uoffset (first 4 bytes) and pass the absolute position to `visit_table(..)`, which performs the same structural checks governed by `VerifierOptions` (depth, table count, apparent size) without schema knowledge.
- This keeps the validator independent of generated code and resilient to flatbuffers crate changes.

3) Consistency with flatstream’s framing model
- flatstream uses its own 4-byte length header; the payload FlatBuffer itself is not size-prefixed by the builder. Reading the uoffset at payload start and visiting the table matches this model precisely.
- If future payloads include size-prefixed FlatBuffers, we can add a variant to handle that, but today the explicit path is correct and minimal.

4) Zero-copy and performance preserved
- `visit_table(..)` operates directly on the in-place buffer and is fully bounds-checked, preserving zero-copy behavior and safety.

In short, the manual verifier path is the only portable, type-agnostic option supported by the current Rust flatbuffers API, and it aligns with our wire format. We retain it and document the rationale here for future maintainers.
